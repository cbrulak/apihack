Thinkful API Hack Project

You're nearly done with this course: it's time to bring together everything you've learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX in a single project, an API hack. You'll gain experience researching RESTful APIs and designing client-side applications to interface with them, and see a project through from ideation to implementation.

Below is a list of project requirements; the assignments in this lesson provide detailed guidance for each step.

Project Requirements
The application must make use of a third-party API and use the results to change the DOM. You will need to choose the API you wish to use and how you will use the data.
You must plan your app in detail before you start building.
Try making your project responsive using media queries, as you learned in unit 1.
You should specifically look for an API that offers response data in the JSONP format.
